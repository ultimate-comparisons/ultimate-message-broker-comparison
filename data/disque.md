# Disque - https://github.com/antirez/disque
in-memory, distributed job queue


## Description
Disque is an ongoing experiment to build a distributed, in-memory, message broker. Its goal is to capture the essence of the 'Redis as a jobs queue' use case, which is usually implemented using blocking list operations, and move it into an ad-hoc, self-contained, scalable, and fault tolerant design, with simple to understand properties and guarantees, but still resembling Redis in terms of simplicity, performance, and implementation as a C non-blocking networked server.
